If you run into issues or have questions, you can use our mailing list: vitess@googlegroups.com.

Dependencies


We currently develop on Ubuntu 14.04 (Trusty) and Debian 7.0 (Wheezy).
You&#39;ll need some kind of Java Runtime if you use ZooKeeper.
We use OpenJDK (sudo apt-get install openjdk-7-jre).
Go 1.3+: Needed for building Vitess.
MariaDB: We currently develop with version 10.0.14.
Other 10.0.x versions may also work.
ZooKeeper
or etcd 0.4.6:
By default, Vitess uses ZooKeeper as the lock service.
We also have a plugin for etcd. See the Building section below.
It is possible to plug in something else as long as the new service supports
the necessary API functions.
Memcached: Used for the rowcache.
Python 2.7: For the client and testing.


Building

Install Go.

Install MariaDB.
You can use any installation method (src/bin/rpm/deb),
but be sure to include the client development headers (libmariadbclient-dev).

ZooKeeper 3.3.5 is included by default. If you plan to use it, you don&#39;t need
to install anything else.

If you want to use etcd instead, install
etcd 0.4.6
and make sure the &quot;etcd&quot; command is on your path.

Then download and build Vitess. Note that the value of MYSQL_FLAVOR is case-sensitive.
If the mysql_config command from libmariadbclient-dev is not on the PATH,
you&#39;ll need to export VT_MYSQL_ROOT=/path/to/mariadb before running bootstrap.sh,
where mysql_config is found at /path/to/mariadb/bin/mysql_config.
cd $WORKSPACE
sudo apt-get install make automake libtool memcached python-dev python-mysqldb libssl-dev g++ mercurial git pkg-config bison curl
git clone https://github.com/youtube/vitess.git src/github.com/youtube/vitess
cd src/github.com/youtube/vitess
export MYSQL_FLAVOR=MariaDB
./bootstrap.sh
. ./dev.env
make build

Testing

If you want to use etcd, set the following environment variable:
export VT_TEST_FLAGS=&#39;--topo-server-flavor=etcd&#39;

The full set of tests included in the default make and make test targets
is intended for use by Vitess developers to verify code changes.
These tests simulate a small cluster by launching many servers on the local
machine, so they require a lot of resources (minimum 8GB RAM and SSD recommended).

If you are only interested in checking that Vitess is working in your
environment, you can run a set of lighter tests:
make site_test

Common Test Issues

Many common failures come from running the full developer test suite
(make or make test) on an underpowered machine. If you still get
these errors with the lighter set of site tests (make site_test),
please let us know on the mailing list.

Node already exists, port in use, etc.

Sometimes a failed test may leave behind orphaned processes.
If you use the default settings, you can find these by looking for
vtdataroot in the command line, since every process is told to put
its files there with a command line flag. For example:
pgrep -f -l &#39;(vtdataroot|VTDATAROOT)&#39; # list Vitess processes
pkill -f &#39;(vtdataroot|VTDATAROOT)&#39; # kill Vitess processes

Too many connections to MySQL, or other timeouts

This often means your disk is too slow. If you don&#39;t have access to an SSD,
you can try testing against a ramdisk.

Connection refused to tablet, MySQL socket not found, etc.

This could mean you ran out of RAM and a server crashed when it tried to allocate more.
Some of the heavier tests currently require up to 8GB RAM.

Connection refused in zkctl test

This could indicate that no Java Runtime is installed.

Running out of disk space

Some of the larger tests use up to 4GB of temporary space on disk.

Setting up a cluster

Once you have a successful make build, you can proceed to start up a
local cluster
for testing.
